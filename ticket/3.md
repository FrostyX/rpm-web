rpm compilation fails on GNU/Hurd due unconditionalized PATH\_MAX

### Description {#comment:description}

GNU/Hurd doesn\'t have PATH\_MAX macro defined. POSIX says when this
macro is undefined path can be unlimited but I don\'t think you have to
deal with unlimited paths right now. Attached patch should be
sufficient.

-   **status** changed from *new* to *closed*.
-   **resolution** set to *fixed*.

What I\'ve had in mind is to add a mallocing version of realpath() to
librpmio to avoid PATH\_MAX and related issues completely but this\'ll
do for now. Applied, thanks for the patch.

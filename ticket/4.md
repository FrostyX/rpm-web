rpm compilation fails on GNU/Hurd due missing SA\_SIGINFO

### Description {#comment:description}

Compilation fails on GNU/Hurd due missing SA\_SIGINFO. GNU/Hurd has only
\"old style\" signal API. Proposed patch fixes the problem.

I\'m not sure if you want include signal.h directly in rpmsq.h. If yes
then it seems SA\_SIGINFO conditional building has to be handled through
configure & config.h.

-   **status** changed from *new* to *closed*.
-   **resolution** set to *fixed*.

Seems reasonable to me. Applied, thanks for the patch.

-   **status** changed from *closed* to *reopened*.
-   **resolution** deleted.

Hm, after inspection previous patch was incomplete. Compilation emits
those errors: rpmsq.c:159: warning: initialization from incompatible
pointer type rpmsq.c:161: warning: initialization from incompatible
pointer type rpmsq.c:163: warning: initialization from incompatible
pointer type rpmsq.c:165: warning: initialization from incompatible
pointer type rpmsq.c:167: warning: initialization from incompatible
pointer type rpmsq.c:169: warning: initialization from incompatible
pointer type rpmsq.c: In function \'rpmsqEnable\': rpmsq.c:276: warning:
pointer type mismatch in conditional expression

Problem is in rpmsqAction function. Prototype/definition has to be
conditionalized as well:

\#ifdef SA\_SIGINFO void rpmsqAction(int signum, void \* info, void \*
context); \#else void rpmsqAction(int signum); \#endif

-   **status** changed from *reopened* to *closed*.
-   **resolution** set to *fixed*.

Duh, of course :) Added now\...

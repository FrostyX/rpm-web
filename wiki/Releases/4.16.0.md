* Promote the ndb backend out of experimental status
* Add experimental sqlite-based backend
* Add experimental read-only BDB support as independent implementation

#### Spec
* Remove support for bare words in %if expressions (eg a == b)

#### Macros
* Add consistent argument checking to built-in macros

* Add built-in %{macrobody:...} macro to retrieve the literal body of
  a macro (#582)
* Fix double-expansion on built-in macros (#313)

  (eg %[ ... FIXME EXAMPLE ... ])
* Add support for short-circuit for logical and ternary operators
  (eg FIXME EXAMPLE)
* Add support for not operator on arbitrary items (eg !"%?foo")

### API changes

#### Added APIs
* Add rpmdbIndexKeyIteratorInit() for key-only rpmdb index iterator
* Add rpmPushMacroFlags() for finer control over macro definitions
* Add rpmMacroIsDefined() and rpmMacroIsParametric() for determining
